To untrack a single file that has already been added/initialized to your repository, i.e., stop tracking the file but not delete it from your system use: git rm --cached filename

To untrack every file that is now in your .gitignore:

First commit any outstanding code changes, and then, run this command:

git rm -r --cached .
This removes any changed files from the index(staging area), then just run:

git add .
Commit it:

git commit -m ".gitignore is now working"



All my changes to be uploaded to "master" branch, and let main branch to be in synch with original repo (Brasil)



it push
fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin master
